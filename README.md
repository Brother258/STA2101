# Dhaka AQ: Analysis of Daily Air Quality & Weather Data

An academic project for **STA 2101: Statistics & Probability**  
**University of Liberal Arts Bangladesh (ULAB)**

---

## 📘 Abstract
This project analyzes the relationship between **weather conditions** and **air pollution levels** in Dhaka, Bangladesh.  
Using the ["Dhaka Daily Air Quality & Weather"](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/albab12/dhaka-daily-air-quality-and-weather-dataset) dataset, the study explores how temperature, humidity, pressure, and wind speed correlate with air quality indicators such as AQI, PM2.5, PM10, CO, and others.  
The analysis applies statistical and probabilistic methods from the **STA 2101** course to uncover key factors that influence Dhaka’s air quality.

## 🎯 Project Objectives
- Identify significant correlations between weather variables (temperature, humidity, pressure, wind speed) and daily AQI.  
- Determine which pollutants (PM2.5, PM10, CO, NO₂, O₃, SO₂) are most influenced by changes in weather.  
- Apply probability and statistical concepts such as descriptive analysis, correlation, and hypothesis testing.  
- Model the probability of “Unhealthy” or “Hazardous” AQI days based on meteorological conditions.  
- Provide data-driven insights into the environmental dynamics of Dhaka.

## 🔬 Methodology

### 1. Data Preparation
- Load and clean the dataset using Pandas  
- Handle missing values and ensure consistent data types  
- Feature engineering (categorizing AQI levels)

### 2. Descriptive Statistics
- Compute mean, median, standard deviation, and range  
- Visualize data using histograms, box plots, and summary tables

### 3. Correlation Analysis
- Apply **Pearson** and **Spearman** correlation tests  
- Use heatmaps and scatter plots to visualize relationships between weather variables and pollutants

### 4. Probability & Hypothesis Testing
- Test statistical significance of observed correlations  
- Example hypothesis:  
  *H₀: There is no correlation between temperature and AQI*  
  *H₁: There is a significant correlation between temperature and AQI*

### 5. Predictive Modeling
- Implement **Logistic Regression** to classify Unhealthy AQI days  
- Evaluate using accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC metrics
